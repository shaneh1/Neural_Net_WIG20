# Neural_Net_WIG20
LSTM Neural Network which forecasts the closing price of the WIG20 for one day in advance. Takes in a csv file containing Date, Open, High, Low, and Close. A target variable of price on the day t is created which is equal to closing price on day t-1. Keras library is used to build LSTM neural network with 1 hidden layer, containing 100 neurons. The best RMSE achieved on the test set is approximately 23.
